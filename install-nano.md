## Install Nano

We encourage you to choose nano as the default text editor for Git. Nano is fairly simple to use, with instructions to remind you how it works at the bottom of the window. However, installing nano can be a little tricky. Here are instructions if you are using a Windows machine. Mac users should already have nano installed on their computer! You can test this by opening a `terminal`, then typing `nano test.txt`. If a file opens up with commands such as "Write out" at the bottom, then it worked. If you do not have nano installed for some reason, please use Google to figure out how to get it. For Windows users, the installation instructions are:

    1. Go to this website: https://www.trishtech.com/2020/11/how-to-install-nano-editor-in-windows-10/
    2. Click on the link in step 1 and find the latest version of nano. Download it and give it permission to be installed/edit device if it asks. 
    3. Go to https://www.7-zip.org/ and download the version of 7-zip (version 19.00) that works for your computer (may be 64-bit may be 32-bit)
    4. Install 7-zip and give it whatever permission it asks for (should be a very fast installation)
    5. Open 7-zip and go to the nano installation folder in 7-zip (Might be in C:/Users/**YOURNAME**/Downloads/).
    6. Press on the folder (The one with x86 is for 64-bit) and click on the "Extract" button at the top.
    7. It should then have extracted nano. Outside of 7-zip, go into the folder and into the bin file to find nano.exe. 
    8. Copy nano.exe and paste it into your C:/Windows/ folder for simple access.
    9. Run nano.exe, if it worked then you should see a small black terminal with some tips at the bottom!
