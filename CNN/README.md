We will be using [John Wu's github demo of convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/jwuphysics/convnet-demo) for this tutorial. CNNs are powerful machine learning tools that are often used to classify objects given images. First, skim over [this long document](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#overview) from a Stanford CS class that explains what CNN are and how they work. This is for sure a complicated topic, so I would suggest having this document handy while going over the actual tutorial but not focusing incredibly hard on fully understanding every single thing. John Wu wrote a paper based off what is being done in his CNN demo, so please feel free to read over the abstract of the paper listed on his github. Check out the wikipedia page for Metallicity to better understand what is being determined in this demo. 

Prior to following the instructions below, note that some people are having issues with running the current iteration of the "Metallicity prediction demo.ipynb" from start to finish. If you start to move through the tutorial that comes with the instructions below and run into issues that seem like certain functions cannot be called or fail to work, consider downloading [this more updated version of the tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jwuphysics/convnet-demo/blob/colab/notebook/Metallicity%20prediction%20demo.ipynb) 

To run this tutorial:
* We will be using a version of the tutorial that I had on my harddrive. First, download the .zip file in this repository and then upload it to your google drive.
* Then, extract it in Google Drive using the "Zip Extractor" app. This step may take 10+ minutes. (you must do it this way as google drive doesn't like when you upload more than 100 files at once, and there are a lot of small images)
* Once the extraction is done, go into google drive and rename the folder `convnet-demo-20210605T163933Z-001` to just `convnet-demo`
* Go into the folder you just uploaded and then into the notebooks folder and right-click on the file called "Metallicity prediction demo.ipynb" and open it with Google Colaboratory. 
* Google Colaboratory is very similarly to Jupyter, so run each cell by pressing shift+enter. 
* In the third cell, you may have to change the code from `PATH = os.path.abspath('/content/drive/My Drive/convnet-demo')` to `PATH = os.path.abspath('/content/drive/My Drive/convnet-demo/convnet-demo')` or something similar to represent the slightly different path.
