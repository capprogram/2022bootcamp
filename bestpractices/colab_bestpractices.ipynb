        "Just for fun, the code for this tutorial will explore the Central Limit Theorem by comparing Poisson distributions with Gaussian distributions. A \"distribution\" is a function giving the probabilities (plotted on the y axis) associated with different outcomes (values of x), so the whole function integrates to the sum of all possible probabilities: 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of a Poisson process is counting the # of people who use the gym per hour where the count is run for a period of time nhr (set to = different times). We assume the underlying average users per hour U is fixed but the counts have \"Poisson fluctuations\" so N = nhr x U specifies the *expected* count (the mean of the theoretical Poisson distribution) not the observed count Nobs, whose possible values have different probabilities following a Poisson distribution with mean N. (In fact nhr may need to be very large for N to exactly equal Nobs, because Nobs is by definition an integer, but U is by definition a real number.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical theory tells us that for a Poisson process, the observed count Nobs fluctuates around the true theoretical mean N with a 68% confidence interval of +-sqrt(N) for \"large N\". The sleight of hand of statistics is to use the observed data to estimate N as Nobs and likewise estimate the 68% confidence interval as +-sqrt(Nobs). Thus the estimated fractional error in the count is fracerr = sqrt(Nobs)/Nobs = 1/sqrt(Nobs). The 1/sqrt explains why we get a  better estimate of U by running the count for 10 hours rather than 1 hour. However in the code we will not use data but simply compare the theoretical distributions while increasing N (or equivalently, increasing nhr).\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the Central Limit Theorem, as we increase N, the Poisson distribution should start to look like a Gaussian. Therefore we will plot the Poisson distribution for increasing N and overplot Gaussians with the same mean N and 68% confidence interval +-sqrt(N), to see how quickly the Poisson shape approaches a Gaussian shape (i.e., to determine when we reach the \"large N\" limit). This topic can be a bit difficult to understand if this is your first time being introduced to it. Please don't be afraid to skip ahead into the tutorials on basic statistics or google other resources to get a better sense of how this works."

When you find a slow step, ask yourself whether it could be faster, and whether it matters (is it the rate-limiting step?). For now, fix it even if it's not the rate-limiting step, just for practice.
