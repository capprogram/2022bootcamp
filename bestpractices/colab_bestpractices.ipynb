A \"distribution\" is a function giving the probabilities (plotted on the y axis) associated with different outcomes (values of x), so the whole function integrates to the sum of all possible probabilities: 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of a Poisson process is counting the # of people who use the gym per hour where the count is run for a period of time nhr (set to = different times). We assume the underlying average users per hour U is fixed but the counts have \"Poisson fluctuations\" so N = nhr x U specifies the *expected* count (the mean of the theoretical Poisson distribution) not the observed count Nobs, whose possible values have different probabilities following a Poisson distribution with mean N. (In fact nhr may need to be very large for N to exactly equal Nobs, because Nobs is by definition an integer, but U is by definition a real number.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical theory tells us that for a Poisson process, the observed count Nobs fluctuates around the true theoretical mean N with a 68% confidence interval of +-sqrt(N) for \"large N\". The sleight of hand of statistics is to use the observed data to estimate N as Nobs and likewise estimate the 68% confidence interval as +-sqrt(Nobs). Thus the estimated fractional error in the count is fracerr = sqrt(Nobs)/Nobs = 1/sqrt(Nobs). The 1/sqrt explains why we get a  better estimate of U by running the count for 10 hours rather than 1 hour. However in the code we will not use data but simply compare the theoretical distributions while increasing N (or equivalently, increasing nhr).\n",

Therefore we will plot the Poisson distribution for increasing N and overplot Gaussians with the same mean N and 68% confidence interval +-sqrt(N), to see how quickly the Poisson shape approaches a Gaussian shape (i.e., to determine when we reach the \"large N\" limit)."

When you find a slow step, ask yourself whether it could be faster, and whether it matters (is it the rate-limiting step?). For now, fix it even if it's not the rate-limiting step, just for practice.
