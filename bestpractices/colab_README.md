## Programming Best Practices

To complete this tutorial:

 * Go to the Github Bootcamp page and go into the directory for "bestpractices"
 * Click on the colab_bestpractices.ipynb link
 * After that, copy the URL, go to https://colab.research.google.com and click on the github tab when opening a file
 * If you are okay with it, allow google drive to have access to your github. This script should still work if you deny access.
 * Paste the URL you have copied there and press on the magnifying glass
 * It should then automatically launch the file in Colab. ***Save a copy of the file to your own drive***
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter
 * Run the first cell to connect your drive to this script and to download two other files needed for this tutorial. It will ask you to authorize your google drive by going to another url and copy/pasting a token.
 * When you get to the part where you need to edit the "templatecode" scripts, you should be able to find them in your google drive bootcamp folder. You may open them up with the "Text Editor" program or Vi if you're comfortable with that. Be sure to save them before you run them in the main google colab notebook.
