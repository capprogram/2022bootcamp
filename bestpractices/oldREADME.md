  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/bestpractices/master/bestpractices.ipynb -P /home/jovyan/demo`
 * paste both of the following into the terminal to get the two python codes:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/bestpractices/master/templatecode.py -P /home/jovyan/demo` <br>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/bestpractices/master/templatecodeprotected.py -P /home/jovyan/demo`
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook and open the two python codes by double clicking on them
=======
 * Go to the Github Bootcamp page and go into the directory for "bestpractices" (which you are probably already in if you see this document)
 * Click on the colab_bestpractices.ipynb link
 * After that, copy the URL, go to https://colab.research.google.com and click on the github tab when opening a file
 * If you are okay with it, allow google drive to have access to your github. This script should still work if you deny access.
 * Paste the URL you have copied there and press on the magnifying glass
 * It should then automatically launch the file in Colab. ***Save a copy of the file to your own drive***
