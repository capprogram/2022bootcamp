## Exploring Jupyter Notebooks

Updated June 2021 by D. Carr

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `ExploreEco.ipynb` file in the `explorejupyternotebooks` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter.
