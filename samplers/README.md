Check out [this link](http://mattpitkin.github.io/samplers-demo/pages/samplers-samplers-everywhere/) on different types of samplers. This includes MCMC sampling (which we should already have some experience with) along with nested samplers. This tutorial is fairly long and relies on importing a lot of different packages that probably are not installed on your anaconda, so feel free to just follow along with their code as long as it is interesting to you. It also cites a shorter, yet similar tutorial by Jake VanderPlas at the top that may be helpful as well.
