# 1. Sign up for GitHub

1. Visit https://github.com/ and pick a username to set up an account. Youâ€™ll probably use GitHub long past this boot camp, so bear that in mind when deciding what email address to give.

2. Give us your username so we can invite you to join the `capprogram` organization.

3. Visit https://github.com/capprogram to accept the invitation to join the 
`capprogram` organization.

# 2. Install Git

Install git for your laptop from one of these links:

1. [Install for MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
2. [Install for Win](https://git-for-windows.github.io) 
 
For Windows Git installation, all the default installation options are fine except you may prefer to decline using vim as the default text editor and choose nano instead (you will see instructions to change this later if you would like to). Make sure to also get the credential manager core as well. For Mac, git will install without any installation option decisions and will be usable from the terminal.

For now, just install Git (and possibly restart your computer if it says to) and we can play with it later. Return back to the main wiki and continue with the tutorials
