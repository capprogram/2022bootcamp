Please review [this excerpt on random forests](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.08-random-forests.html) from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/) by Jake VanderPlas.
This tutorial comes with a Google Colaboratory link that you can click on to actively run the code in a format that is very similar to JupyterLab. Note that the last 3 cells may not run due to a package issue, but you can see the output of those cells for yourself on the actual webpage.
