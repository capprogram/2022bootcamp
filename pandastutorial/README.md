Check out the [10 Minutes to pandas guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/10min.html) to see if you'd like to learn more about this powerful data manipulation package. If you've learned about jupyter notebooks, you can play with some useful pandas commands in this pandas tutorial notebook.

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2022bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
 * It can take up to 5 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `pandas_tutorial.ipynb` file in the `pandastutorial` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter.
